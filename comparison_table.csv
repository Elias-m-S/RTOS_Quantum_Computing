Scheduling Approach,Description,Advantages,Disadvantages,Time Complexity,Use Case / Application
Priority-Based Scheduling,"Traditional priority-based scheduling adapted for quantum tasks. Higher priority given to tasks with shorter coherence times.","Simple to implement; Well-understood from classical RTOS; Fast scheduling decisions","May lead to starvation; Does not guarantee deadlines; Priority inversion issues","O(1) to O(n)","Short quantum circuits with varying urgency levels"
Deadline-Driven Scheduling,"EDF (Earliest Deadline First) adapted for quantum computing. Deadlines set based on decoherence limits.","Optimal for single processor; Guarantees deadlines if feasible; Better utilization","Complex feasibility analysis; Overhead in deadline computation; May waste quantum resources","O(n log n)","Hard real-time quantum applications with strict timing requirements"
Time-Slicing and Circuit Partitioning,"Quantum circuits divided into smaller schedulable units with intermediate measurements.","Allows context switching; Better resource sharing; Flexible scheduling","State preservation overhead; Increased decoherence risk; Complex partitioning decisions","O(n^2) for partitioning","Long quantum algorithms that exceed coherence time"
Hybrid Classical-Quantum Scheduling,"Co-schedules classical and quantum resources considering communication delays.","Optimizes overall system; Reduces idle time; Communication-aware","High complexity; Requires coordination; Difficult to predict execution time","O(n^2 to n^3)","Variational quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA) with classical-quantum loops"
Predictive and Adaptive Scheduling,"Machine learning-based approaches that learn from hardware characteristics and adapt online.","Adapts to hardware; Learns optimal strategies; Can handle variability","Requires training data; Overhead in prediction; May not work for new workloads","Varies (training: O(n^3), inference: O(n))","Complex quantum systems with repeating workload patterns"
Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS),"Fixed-priority scheduling based on task periodicity. Shorter period = higher priority.","Predictable behavior; Static analysis possible; Well-studied bounds","Requires periodic tasks; May have low utilization; Limited to specific task models","O(n)","Periodic quantum error correction tasks"
Quantum Annealing Scheduling,"Specialized scheduling for quantum annealing systems. Focus on parameter scheduling.","Optimized for annealing; Considers energy landscape; Hardware-specific","Limited to annealing hardware; Not general-purpose; Narrow application","Problem-dependent","Quantum optimization problems on D-Wave systems"
